# LESSONS_LEARNED.md

Things learned while developing the bot, so they are not investigated again
and mistakes are not repeated. Short, dated, factual entries — newest first.

- `maps/scripts/NonVisualTrigger.js` override works: the engine registers it
  as a custom trigger script in every `-autostart-nonvisual` game, and the
  brennus copy (mounted after public) wins. Verified in-game.
- A no-op bot vs sandbox Petra never ends a `conquest_civic_centers` game on
  its own — a time-limit trigger calling
  `EndGameManager.MarkPlayersAsWon([1], ...)` ends it cleanly: engine exits 0,
  `metadata.json` + statistics JSON written.
- `StatisticsTracker.GetStatisticsJSON()` (the stdout per-player JSON) has NO
  `timeElapsed` field in 0.28.0; simulation time is in the replay's
  `metadata.json` (`timeElapsed`, ms).
- Statistics JSON on stdout is pretty-printed (`"playerState": "won"` with a
  space) — grep patterns must account for that.
- Turn rate with few entities (no-op bot vs sandbox Petra, mainland 192):
  ~375 turns/s (9000 turns in ~24 s wall), much faster than the ~113 t/s
  from the busier smoke-test match. Size wall timeouts accordingly.
- Trigger-script scheduling: `cmpTrigger.DoAfterDelay(ms, "MethodName", {})`
  calls `Trigger.prototype.MethodName`; simulation ms (200 ms/turn).
