- **Petra "defensive" behaviour still kills an undefended boom bot.**
  Goal-9 first full match (seed 1): Petra difficulty 3 + behaviour
  `defensive` conquered the goal-8 bot at turn 9270 (~31 in-game min) —
  killed 1068 of 1069 workers and every expansion CC. "Defensive"
  restrains tempo, not willingness to attack an economy with no army.
- **Sim rate drops with a real opponent.** ~32 turns/s vs medium Petra
  (9270 turns in ~5:10 wall incl. startup) versus ~113 turns/s vs a
  sandbox. A 45-min match ≈ 7 wall minutes serial; size goal-9 batches
  accordingly (parallelize across cores).
- `-autostart-aibehavior` values (0.28.0): `random` / `balanced` /
  `defensive` / `aggressive` (autostart default `balanced`); difficulty
  index 3 = medium.
