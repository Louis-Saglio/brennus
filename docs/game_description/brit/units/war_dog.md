## Guide

The War Dog (Agrocuna) is the British kennel unit — the game's only
**0-population combat unit**. For 100 food and 15 s at the kennel
(Village phase) you get a 110 HP, 1/1/1 armor chaser that runs at 27 m/s
— the fastest land unit in the game (only scout ships are quicker) —
and bites for 7 hack + 2 pierce
every 1 s. Its limits are hard ones: it **cannot attack Structures,
Ships or Siege** (the attack carries `RestrictedClasses Structure Ship
Siege`), it cannot gather or build, and it has only 30 m vision. It
counts as `Human` class (not `Infantry`), so it is healable and is
covered by Cunobeline's regeneration aura but not by the Woad Warriors
bonus. The kennel is capped at 1 per player and each dog is 100 food —
so dogs are a food-sink for the civ that has none of the population cost
of real soldiers: swarm them as pop-free cannon fodder, raiders of
villagers and corpse-guards, not as a main line. One starts the match
with the Britons.
