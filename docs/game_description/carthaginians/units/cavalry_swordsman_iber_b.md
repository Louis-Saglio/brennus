Stats resolved from `simulation/templates/units/cart/cavalry_swordsman_iber_b` (full cart template chain).

## Guide

The Iberian Heavy Cavalry is a stat-twin of the Gallic Mercenary Cavalry (160 HP, 9.9-hack sword, 20 food + 90 metal, 10.5 s, no gathering, 0-XP auto-promotion, 300 XP for Elite) but with a practical catch: no buildable embassy trains it. Its only trainer token lives on the vestigial all-in-one `embassy`, which no builder lists, so it is unreachable through the normal build UI — a construct command placed directly on that embassy still works. For skirmish play the Gallic Mercenary Cavalry from the Celtic embassy is the obtainable equivalent; this template is effectively a map-script/trigger unit.
