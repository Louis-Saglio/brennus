## Guide

The Balearic Slinger is the long-range mercenary skirmisher: a 50 m sling doing 14.55 pierce + 1.39 crush (the crush chip helps against structures) — it outranges the 30 m javelin line and is outranged only by the 60 m Mauritanian archer, so it wins the ranged duel against other skirmishers and slingers once the 50 HP slinger kites. It costs 75 metal and trains in 7 s at the Iberian embassy (Town phase), hits +10% harder than a citizen slinger, cannot gather, and auto-promotes to Advanced at 0 XP. It is the mercenary answer to enemy ranged units and workers behind walls, but like every Carthaginian mercenary it is a pure metal expense — keep it supplied and protected, as 1/1 armor dies to any melee contact.
