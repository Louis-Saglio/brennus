## Guide

Hamilcar Barca is the fast Carthaginian cavalry hero: walk 18 m/s (run 25.2), a 26-hack sword at 0.75 s repeat, and 1200 HP with 11/9/25 armor — a durable, mobile fighter suited to raiding and reinforcing a moving front. He carries two auras at once: "Lightning General" (+15% walk speed for own Soldiers and Siege engines within 60 m, so he is a force-multiplier for the whole army on the march) and "Subduer of Mercenaries" (enemy Mercenary units within 60 m deal −20% melee and ranged damage — valuable against mercenary-heavy civilisations). At 300 metal he is a premium purchase; like all heroes he costs 0 population, is limited to 1 alive, and is trained at the fortress (city phase).
