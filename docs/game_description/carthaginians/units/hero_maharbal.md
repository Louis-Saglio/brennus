## Guide

Maharbal is the Carthaginian cavalry-command hero: a fast spear-armed horseman (walk 18 m/s) whose spear does 16 hack + 12 pierce with a 1.75× bonus vs Cavalry, so he fights well against enemy horse. His "Cavalry Commander" aura gives every Melee Cavalry unit within 60 m +30% melee attack damage, which stacks with Carthage's own cavalry (the Numidian cavalry javelineers, the mercenary horsemen and the Sacred Band Cavalry) to make a Maharbal-led cavalry wing hit far above its weight. At 250 metal he is the cheapest of the three heroes but still a premium; 0 population, limited to 1 alive, trained at the fortress (city phase).
