- civil_centre

Note: researched at the civil centre from the start of the match (no phase requirement, only the civ gate). It makes Carthage's civic-centre expansion cheaper — a new CC drops from 300 wood / 300 stone / 250 metal to 225 / 225 / 187.5 — and also discounts houses and temples. Research it before planting additional civic centres.
