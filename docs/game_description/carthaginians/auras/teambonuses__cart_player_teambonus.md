## Carthaginian

- attached by `special/players/<civ>.xml` (the player's teambonus)

Note: applies to every ally (Carthage included) and only to `Mercenary` **Infantry** — the swordsmen, spearman, skirmisher and slinger mercenaries — not to the mercenary cavalry. Combined with the mercenaries' already-short 7 s train time, Carthaginian infantry mercenaries (and those of its allies) train in 3.5 s.
