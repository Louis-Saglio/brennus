## Guide

The Iberian Embassy is Carthage's ranged-mercenary building: from the Town phase it trains the Iberian Mercenary Skirmisher (80 metal, 17.6-pierce javelins at 30 m) and the Balearic Slinger (75 metal, 50 m range — outranged only by the Mauritanian archer among Carthage's infantry). Both are 7 s trains, hit +10% harder than citizen equivalents, auto-promote to Advanced at 0 XP and cannot gather — pure metal expenditure for fire support. Since Carthage's citizen ranged roster is only the Mauritanian archer (plus the Numidian cavalry javelineer), this embassy is where the civ gets its skirmish and sling line. It costs 100 wood + 100 stone — stone is scarce, so it is a real investment — and with 2000 HP it is the sturdiest of the three embassies. Built by Carthaginian women and infantry.
