## Guide

The Celtic Embassy is Carthage's mercenary recruitment building for Gallic troops: from the Town phase it trains the Gallic Mercenary Swordsman (60 metal, 7 s) and the Gallic Mercenary Cavalry (20 food + 90 metal, 10.5 s) — Carthage's only citizen-grade sword infantry and sword cavalry, since the civ has no citizen swordsmen of its own. It is the cheapest embassy at 200 wood, and the only one that researches a tech: the City-phase "Celtic Auxiliaries" (550 metal), which halves the metal cost of mercenary swordsmen while adding 50 food each. With the team bonus ("Mercenary Transports", −50% train time for mercenary infantry) the swordsman line is Carthage's fastest way to field melee infantry. It is a small, fragile building (1200 HP) — protect it, as losing it cuts off the sword line entirely. Built by Carthaginian women and infantry.
