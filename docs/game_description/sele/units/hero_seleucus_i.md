## Guide

Seleucus I Nikator (Seleukos A' Nikatōr) is the Seleucid elephant hero —
1500 HP with 10/10/25 armor and the standard elephant trunk attack (60
hack + 90 crush every 1.5 s at 5 m), doubling as a slow-moving siege
engine. His aura, "Zooiarchos" (+20% melee damage and +20% speed for
champion elephants within 60 m), is the amplifier for the civ's armored
war elephants (already 1100 HP / 33 hack + 49.5 crush): with Seleucus
alive the elephant corps is the hardest-hitting melee screen in the
game. Uniquely among the Seleucid heroes he is a 0-population unit
trained at the **civic centre** (City phase) — same building as the
other two heroes — and is subject to the global limit of 1 hero alive at
a time, which for the Seleucids also gates the second civic centre (see
`civ.md`).
