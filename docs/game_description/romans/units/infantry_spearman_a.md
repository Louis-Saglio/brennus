Stats resolved from `simulation/templates/units/rome/infantry_spearman_a` (full roman template chain).

## Guide

Advanced-rank roman spearman trained at the army_camp for 50 food + 50 wood in 10 s, making it a cheap anti-cavalry unit: its Spear attack carries a 2.5× bonus vs Cavalry. As a CitizenSoldier it doubles as a worker (it gathers all four resources and builds), so it can support the economy between fights. Its crush armor (15) is far higher than its hack/pierce armor (3/3), so it is poorly suited to tanking melee or ranged damage despite the cavalry counter role.
