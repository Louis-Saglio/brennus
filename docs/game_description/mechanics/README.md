# Game mechanics of 0 A.D. 0.28.0

One file per **game mechanic**, written for an agent implementing a bot. Unlike the
`units/` / `buildings/` / `technologies/` / `auras/` folders (which catalogue
*data*), these files explain *how the simulation works*: formulas, timings,
edge cases, and what a bot can observe or must do.

**Everything here was verified against the 0 A.D. source reference
(0.28.0, see `AGENTS.md`)** — the simulation components
(`binaries/data/mods/public/simulation/components/*.js`), helpers (`binaries/data/mods/public/simulation/helpers/*.js`),
data (`binaries/data/mods/public/simulation/data/**`), templates (`binaries/data/mods/public/simulation/templates/**`)
and engine source (`source/simulation2/**`). Nothing was written from
memory; every claim carries an inline `path:line` citation (relative to the
reference's root). If a statement looks
wrong, trust the source, not the doc — and fix the doc.
