# infantry_spearman_b

Trained by **13** civilisations. Generic (non-civ-specific) unit of 0 A.D. 0.28.0 — see `docs/game_description/generic/units/README.md` for the method.

Generic stats resolved from the shared template `simulation/templates/template_unit_infantry_melee_spearman` (deepest template common to all civilisation variants; variants may override, see below).

## Guide

The Spearman is the basic melee infantry of most civilisations: 13 of 15 train it (all but mace and ptol, which field pikemen instead), usually at both the civil centre and the barracks, whereas the other melee infantry types are restricted to a few civilisations each (swordsman 5, pikeman 5). Its spear carries a 2.5× attack bonus vs Cavalry, and its cost is only food and wood — the abundant resources — so it is easy to mass (50 food, 50 wood, 10 s, 1 population). As a CitizenSoldier it doubles as an economic unit, gathering food, wood, stone and metal between fights. Its low hack/pierce damage and 100 HP make it a poor general-purpose fighter, so train it as a cavalry counter and mobile worker rather than as a frontline against other infantry. It also carries a small Capture attack (strength 2.5) and ranks up to Advanced and Elite with XP.
