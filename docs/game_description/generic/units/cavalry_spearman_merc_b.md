# cavalry_spearman_merc_b

Trained by **2** civilisations. Generic (non-civ-specific) unit of 0 A.D. 0.28.0 — see `docs/game_description/generic/units/README.md` for the method.

Generic stats resolved from the shared template `simulation/templates/template_unit_cavalry_melee_spearman` (deepest template common to all civilisation variants; variants may override, see below).

## Guide

A mercenary cavalry spearman available to Ptolemies and Seleucids, trained at the Military Colony rather than the Civic Centre. It is the anti-cavalry choice among cavalry: the Spear attack carries a documented 1.75× bonus vs Cavalry, and its speed (run 25.2 m/s) lets it intercept or raid. The civilisation variants cost 20 food + 90 metal — metal instead of food — so it is metal-intensive, a premium unit that is hard to mass, and mercenaries promote automatically (the rank upgrades require 0 XP). Like other CitizenSoldiers it can gather meat (5 food/s), but that is a side use, not its role.
