# ship_fire

Trained by **4** civilisations. Generic (non-civ-specific) unit of 0 A.D. 0.28.0 — see `docs/game_description/generic/units/README.md` for the method.

Generic stats resolved from the shared template `simulation/templates/template_unit_ship_fire` (deepest template common to all civilisation variants; variants may override, see below).

## Guide

The Fire Ship is a cheap naval counter unit: train it at the dock once the Town phase is reached when the enemy fields ships (especially Ram Ships) or coastal buildings, since its flames deal a 3× bonus against both. At 100 wood / 50 metal and only 1 population it is cheap to field, though the metal cost is premium and makes it harder to mass; its low pierce armor (1) means it relies on its high speed (16 m/s walk) to close the 15 m gap before being shot down. It can be ignited mid-battle to cause area damage, after which it cannot be repaired — treat it as a one-way weapon rather than a fleet unit to preserve.
