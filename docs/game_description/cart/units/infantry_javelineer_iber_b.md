## Guide

The Iberian Mercenary Skirmisher is the metal-paid ranged harasser: 80 metal (the most metal of the infantry mercenaries) buys a 50 HP skirmisher throwing 17.6-pierce javelins at 30 m — +10% damage over a citizen javelineer — trained in 7 s at the Iberian embassy from the Town phase. It is fragile (1/1 armor, 50 HP) and cannot gather, so it must stay behind the melee line and kite; its fast feet (walk 11.4 m/s) help it run from trouble. It auto-promotes to Advanced at 0 XP, tightening its spread immediately. Because mercenaries cannot harvest, every one trained is a permanent net consumer of metal rather than a worker that pays for itself — train it for fire support, not as the backbone of the army.
