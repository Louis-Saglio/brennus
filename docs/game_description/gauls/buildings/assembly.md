## Guide

The Assembly of Princes is the gauls' city-phase elite structure: once phase_city is reached, it is the only place to train the champion infantry trumpeter and the three gaul heroes (Brennus, Viridomarus, Vercingetorix). At 400 wood and a 200 s build time it is a cheap, wood-only building that is easy to afford and mass, and its 40 m territory influence with weight 40000 also helps expand or hold territory. Its 20 garrison slots let it shelter units. Build it when pushing for champions or heroes.
