# tavern

Gaul-specific building of 0 A.D. 0.28.0 — only the gauls can build it. See `docs/game_description/gauls/buildings/README.md` for the method; shared buildings are documented in `docs/game_description/generic/buildings/`.

Stats resolved from `simulation/templates/structures/gaul/tavern` (parent `template_structure_civic_house`).

## Guide

The Tavern (Taberna) is a gaul phase-town structure that doubles as a house: it inherits the house's `House` class, its female-citizen trainer and its house-technology researcher, while carrying a +10 population bonus — double a house's +5 — for 100 wood + 100 stone and a 200 s build time. It is the cheapest Town-class structure, so it is the natural third member of the city-phase "3 Town-class structures" requirement. No builder template lists it (vestigial, like the archery range), so it is not offered through the normal build UI — but a construct command placed directly still works, because construction does not validate the builder's `Builder/Entities` list.
